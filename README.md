# Jacobhenn's Scarpets

To use, install gnembon/fabric-carpet as a minecraft mod and clone this repo/download individual scripts to the minecraft-folder/saves/my-world/scripts directory.

## re.sc

re.sc allows you to use the `/re` command to search your environment using Regex. Currently, the only available mode is `/re b <pattern>`, which allows you to regex search through nearby blocks. Here is a list of modes I plan to add in the future:
`/re i <pattern>` for searching for matching items in nearby containers
`/re t <pattern>` for searching through nearby text such as signs, renamed items in item frames, and renamed shulker boxes
