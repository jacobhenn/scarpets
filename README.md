## Reccomended usage

Clone this repo to wherever is most convenient. Then, symlink the `scripts/` folder to a `.minecraft/saves/my-world/scripts/` folder in all of the minecraft worlds you want to use them in.

## re.sc

re.sc allows you to use the `/re` command to search your environment using Regex. Currently, the only available mode is `/re b <pattern>`, which allows you to regex search through nearby blocks. Here is a list of modes I plan to add in the future:
`/re i <pattern>` for searching for matching items in nearby containers
`/re t <pattern>` for searching through nearby text such as signs, renamed items in item frames, and renamed shulker boxes
